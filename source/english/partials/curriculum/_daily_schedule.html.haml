      %h3 Day In The Bootcamp
      %p
        No day is alike at Craft Academy and the nature of the Bootcamp changes over time. Sometimes we have more demos and talks, and sometimes more project work. At Craft Academy, we simulate how it is to work in an actual development team as much as possible.
      %p

          Here is how a day could look:
