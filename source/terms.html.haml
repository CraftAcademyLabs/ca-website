  %article
    %h3 Background
    %p
      Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy (run by Adaptive Labs Nordic AB (559330-5005) Gothenburg, Sweden)
      (below “Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy”) is an educational platform for education of computer programming through teacher-led
      courses (“Courses”) which also works in tight connection with the industry in order to be able to create job
      opportunities for all students accepted to Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy for education (“Students”).

    %h3 Applicability
    %p
      These General Terms and Conditions are referred to herein as the “Terms” and apply to all Students.
    %p
      The acceptance of these Terms is a prerequisite in order to at all be able to take part in any Course and they supersede any individual arrangement that may be made explicitly or implicitly between you and Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy.
    %p
      Additional conditions other than those provided in these Terms may apply to certain Courses and will in such case be provided to you in connection with the Course for which they are to apply. Such additional conditions shall be considered to be an integral part of these Terms. Supplemental terms provided in writing to you by Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict between the conditions.
    %p
      Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy has the sole right to at any time amend, supplement or terminate these Terms. Any such made changes to these Terms will be immediately effective after being posted at the same location on the website as these Terms.

    %h3 The education
    %p
      The regular Course consists of a twelve weeks fast-paced and intensive programming “bootcamp”, where you as a Student are required to take active part in the education in order to maximize your personal outcome and put serious effort into learning to program and to develop your programming skills.
    %p
      You should be prepared that the Course generally requires more time than 8 hours of studies a day and that for the best outcome you will have to devote yourself to the education during the Course period. The Education requires that you are able to work individually as well as in teams.
    %h3 Course content and structure
    %p
      No previous programming skills are necessary in order to partake in a Course, although a basic understanding of programming and basic computer skills are needed. Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy may therefore, at its discretion, require you to complete a pre-course prior to the start of the regular Course (see further information on this below under the section “Pre-course”).
      Each regular Course lasts for 12 calendar weeks (including Swedish bank holidays) and education is provided in class at site Mondays to Fridays (except for during bank holidays). Students may after agreement with Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy partake in a Course partly from distance. However, it is strongly recommended that you partake physically for best results and some of the Course elements require physical presence.
    %p
      Courses are held in English or when appropriate in Swedish (only when all Students are Swedish speaking). The course contains elements of teacher-led education, individual and team-based workshops, self-tuition, problem solving, writing of software etc. The Course is ended with a workshop where the Students are required to create a functioning application or other software that could be used in the marketplace (the “Final Project”). However, the content, structure and methods used in each Course are subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the Course that you attend may not be identical to previous Courses, and whilst it will be materially the same, it may not be identical to that described on the Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy website or otherwise in Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy marketing materials. The curriculum of the course is presented to you not later than on the commencement of the Course. As the course continuously evolves, the curriculum applied in the Course may also change from time to time and deviate from what has been presented to you earlier on the website or in other marketing materials.
    %p
      Course materials and literature will be provided during the Course. You will need a portable computer that meets the minimum requirements of Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy in order to partake in the Course. If you are uncertain of whether your computer meets the requirements, please contact Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy prior to registering. It is your obligation to ensure that your computer meets the requirements and can be used in the Course.
    %p
      Deviations from the above general content and structure may apply for certain special Courses provided by Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy. Structure and content for such Courses is provided separately to the Students. These Terms apply in all applicable parts also to such Courses.
    %h4 Prep-course
    %p
      The prep-course will be provided at no additional cost to Students and is intended to ensure that each Student is suitable to participate in the regular Course.
    %p
      Each pre-course will last for approximately 15 hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the regular Course.
    %p
      If a Student fails to complete the pre-course, or Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy reasonably determines that the Student is not suitable to participate in the regular Course (including if the Student does not pass any final technical test set by Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy), the Student shall not be permitted to participate in the regular Course. The Student shall in such case not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid.

    %h3 Expectations
    %p
      You are chosen as a Student to the Course on certain selection criteria, based on an assessment of your possibilities to succeed well in the Course, meaning that Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy has high expectations on your results during the Course and that you will put your best effort into learning. Nomads Of Code/Craft Academy’s goal is to be able to as soon as possible after a finalized Course be able to, through its hiring partners or otherwise, facilitate the process of finding a job for you related to the content learned in a Course (see more about this below under the section “Hiring partner collaborations”).
