    - question: What was the best part of being part of the Craft Academy Bootcamp?
      answer: Being a student at Craft Academy has been one of the most useful and important experience of my life. This is not just a first step into programming, but you will get way deeper into programming than you can even begin to imagine. Before the Bootcamp started I really didn't know anything about coding, 12 weeks later and coding feels like such an important part of my life.
    - question: ..and the hardest part?
      answer: You'll read a lot about the Bootcamp being super-tough, and believe me, it really is, but every single day I really did look forward to going to the office and knew that today I will learn so much new things. The tempo is obviously very high and at times it might feel a bit overwhelming with all the new stuff you are constantly being fed, but in the end you will notice how incredibly much you learnt. Really go for it whole-heartly and it will feel fun rather than tough.
    - question: What are most important thing you've learned?
      answer: The coding stuff is obviously great, that's the knowledge you're being fed, but the thing that really makes this Bootcamp stand out is the working processes. You learn working test driven from the very beginning using version control and from there it just takes on... Simulating real life-projects and the whole idea of Agile methodology and everything that comes along with it like Sprints, Scrums, Reviews and Retrospective. Those are the experiences that are unique, and that really gives you such a great workflow and preaparation for your future career.
    - question: What would be your advice to anyone that would like to leant to code?  
      answer: The very thing that makes Craft Academy such a great place to start your Programming-career is the whole atmosphere. You are constantly surrounded by incredibly commited coaches and other students. For me it became such an inspiring environment to be in, and I didn't just developed my skills as a programmer, but I feel like I improved a lot as a person.
    - question: Any final words, Erik?
      answer: Going to Craft Academy was one of my best decisions I've ever made. If you have the slightest interest in coding, then this is the place to be. Craft Academy gets my biggest recommendation.

    - quiestion: Who are you? Tell us a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: I am 31 years old Danish guy living in Stockholm with a partner. I have a masters degree en environmental biologi and geography from Roskilde University, Denmark. However I work at a IT hosting company, Itadel A/S, as a site manager. Which means I work with the physical hardware in datacenters. I like to work with computers, but in my current job I don't have the opportunity to create stuff. I would like that, and I think learning to program could help me in my goal to work with computers AND create.
    - question: What was the best part of being part of the Craft Academy Bootcamp?
      answer: The best, and most fun part of the camp, is when the things you've been taught work when you use them in your projects. When your tests are going green.
    - question: ..and the hardest part?
      answer: The hardest part is to balance the commitment to the camp and your social life. I was aware from the beginning that there won't be much time for sociall activities, but still, when you have a partner, there's a need to balance how you spend your time. That can be tough at times. She's happy it's over.
    - question: What are your plans now that the camp is over?
      answer: The first two weeks after the camp will be spent in the sun. We are going on vacation. After 3 months in a basement, working on a computer, I need a bit of sun. After that, I hope to find a position as a Junior Developer. It's important that I find a company that is commited to agile methodologies, that they practice TDD and Pair Programming, but also that they are prepared to work with me and teach me stuff. 
    - question: What would be your advice to anyone that would like to leant to code?  
      answer: My advice to anyone who is eager to learn programming is to sign up for Craft Academy. It's a wonderful experience - both personally and professionally. Do that.

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: I’m a 28 year old girl from Iceland that decided to move to Gothenburg Sweden to pursue a career in development. I signed up for the coding bootcamp at Craft Academy with no prior experience with coding. Before the bootcamp I studied history and museum studies, worked a bit in museums and for a telecom company.
    - question: During the autumn of 2017, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: When working at the telecom company I felt a need to pursue a career in coding because that’s the future.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: My most important result was to push on through - you can do it, and the results come in the end. It was really hard in the beginning, and I was always comparing myself to other students and felt bad about myself. But when I found my inner peace and just kept on coding the results came.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: It’s intense. You have to keep up and stay focused the whole time, sometimes you feel stupid but then it’s good to talk to your fellow students. Most likely they feel the same way, and you’re not alone. You’re in this together as a group.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: My advice would be keep calm and keep on coding!

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: My name is Faraz Naeem and I had previously owned and operated Kista Redovisningsbyrå which is an accounting agency. The company was a success and we quickly grew into becoming one of the major accounting firms in Kista, which I am very proud of.
    - question: During the summer of 2017, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: Something within me said that I would better fit in a more creative role rather than accounting. When working with accounting you are basically working with past events and presenting it to different stakeholders. I took the decision to change careers when I was building the company's website in Wordpress. It was a lot of fun to create something.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: Like everyone else, I had another picture of ​​how it was to work with technology thanks to watching so many movies over the years. The camp really opened my eyes. The most important effect was probably that 12 weeks before I did not have a clue about coding. Today I can create both web apps, mobile apps and systems. Words like APIs, TDD, HTTP requests are no longer greek to me but clear concepts.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: The intensity of the bootcamp.

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: I am Osegbemoh Dania, from Lagos, Nigeria. I worked as a Network Infrastructure Manager for 9 years with an internet service provider & a chain of pharmaceutical retail stores across Nigeria before my journey to Craft Academy.
    - question: During the spring of 2017, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: I got tired of my networking job and needed a more challenging career path so I decided to try my hands on web app development by launching my own fashion e-commerce store.  I had limited resources outsourcing the web app to a company or freelancer so I developed the website myself using a ready made framework called Magento. I got my e-commerce platform up & running but was unable to develop new features into the platform. This became a struggle for me and had to finally outsource to a freelancer. The desire to develop my own software product sparked my interest in coding. I explored several platforms like EDX, Coursera & Udemy but wasn’t learning fast due to my busy schedule at work and also got distracted trying to learn several programming frameworks at once. I had to resign from my job as a Network Manager to pursue a structured training program in a coding bootcamp.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: The confidence in developing web applications using some of the best practices like test driven & behavioral driven development and the ease of learning new programming languages & development framework.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: Working on new projects weekly with very tight deadlines.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: Don’t hesitate, it’s a great step to learning the most important fundamentals in coding. A bootcamp will help keep you focused, prevent the noise of too many software development frameworks out there and would also provide very good hands-on experience.You also get guidance from professionals who help review your coding style and also guide your thought process when writing code.

      answer: My name is Lucia and I am 28 years old. My background is in molecular biology and I have studied animal and natural sciences since 2007. I have lived in Italy and Sweden and speak Swedish, English and Italian. I love to learn new things every day.
    - question: During the summer of 2016, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: After looking for a job as a biologist for two years, I enrolled at Craft Academy. I decided to give it a try because programming has always been a passion of mine. I signed up to give myself a chance to work hard, develop professional knowledge and feel proud of myself.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: During the bootcamp I learned to code, of course, but the most important experience, without doubt, was improving my communication skills. I learned how to work in a group and cooperate with different people and personalities. I have learned to help others and to ask for help, ask questions and give and receive constructive criticism.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: The bootcamp takes place over 12 weeks, and you have to be prepared that it is not going to be easy! You will definitely be stressed out, tired, frustrated and irritated. The hardest thing is to continue working and studying even when you feel like you want to give up.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: The only advice I want to give to future students is to never give up. Sometimes it feels like your fellow participants are much better than you and that they are all learning faster than you. But everyone learns in their own way. If they accepted you into the course, it means you can do it! Continue fighting, never give up. It's worth the pain because the results come in the end.

  case_study:
      - question: Can you tell us a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
        answer: I am a curious, energised, social and talkative person that loves to challenge myself and to step out of my comfort zone, to see how much I can develop as a person. I am curious and fast learner, which make it self-explanitory that I love to learn new things and experiences. Before this bootcamp, I would say that I was a nomad. Or still am actually. I finished High School in June 2015, and have since then been traveling all around the world. Just for the sake of seeing what is out there. Making my living on the way and living everyday to the fullest.
      - question: During the fall and winter of 2016, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
        answer: I have always had an idea for an application and some website ideas, that I wanted to build and create by myself rather than finding people doing it for me. I tried doing it on my own. But was completely lost in the massive universe of programming. I have also always liked tech and have an interest in seeing how things work and how it looks behind everything that all normal people can see. So when I found Craft Academy, it was quite obvious that I should join the intensive bootcamp.
      - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
        answer: I would say the lifestyle. You will change your whole lifestyle. Open up your mind and make it possible for yourself to develop so much on not just a personal level but also professional and educational level. Something that you won’t realise until you sit there 12 weeks later and realise how much you have developed and how much your mind and yourself is ABLE to develop. You will see that you are able to get things done now, not later. That all the information you never thought you could take in, you can and even more. And that you keep pushing yourself to a limit you thought wasn’t possible.
      - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
        answer: Myself. I have seen sides of me I thought I never had. Both positive and negative. I also realised that you can never stop growing and learn. These two are something that you can be able to affect all the time and keep on working on. Which is also very challenging, because you always have to be open to new things and see that there are things that you can always work on, to be able to develop yourself.
      - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
        answer: Before doing this bootcamp, do some research and do some coding (like Codecademy for example). KNOW what universe you are stepping into. I had no clue and this was a major blocker the first weeks. Then do the prep course. Make sure you do everything, understand everything and ask, ask, ask. Better with a question too much than not knowing. And then of course the actual bootcamp. Im going to be honest. Its not an easy 12 weeks. There are so many up and downs. So much to do and learn. So don’t expect being lazy and doing nothing. it is an intensive course. So be prepared for working 8 hours a day 7days a week for 12 weeks. But hey, the result. Is so worth it. You accomplish, grow and learn so much in these twelve weeks. I can’t be more grateful for doing this course. And it opens up so many doors. Its the beginning of your career basically. Thank you craft academy for giving me this opportunity.

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: I'm Bo Mattsson. I'm 55, married, and we have three grown children. I worked in the finance industry until 1997 (responsible for Swedbank Securities and was, among other things, the creator of Europe's first online stock trader, NetTrade). After that, I became an entrepreneur and have founded or co-founded three companies, which I have subsequently sold (Eurotrade, Mangold and Cint). Cint was sold in December, 2015 to Nordic Capital.
    - question: In the Fall of 2015, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: Partly because I like to learn new things (though I can't say it was exactly new, since I did a little coding in the 70s), and partly because I believe it's healthy to have at least a base understanding of how internet communication actually functions, regardless of device. I have the benefit of seeing directly and additionally become healthier . It's beneficial to have an understanding of how internet communication works. My own businesses benefit from that understanding, and it allows me to play a more engaged role with the companies in which I invest.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: I now understand much better how something is built and what problems the developers have faced. To understand the code makes it easier for me to value the people I hire to build something.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: If you aren't ready to put all of your time into the course and learning to code, you should think again.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: Simple. Put all your time and focus into the course while you're there. Eat, sleep, shit code, period. Ask a lot of questions and make sure you understand something before you move on. Make sure you never ask the same question two times - it's lazy (and nothing irritates a coach as much as a lazy student).

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: My name is Lara and I have been a web designer for over 18 years now (WOW that’s a long time). I have been using CMS like Joomla and WordPress to build my sites and then would outsource all my custom development. I was always so interested in watching my friends code or go through the custom code a developer had worked on for me, even though I had no clue what was going on it excited me and frustrated me.
              So why didn’t I do my BSC degree you may ask, well, first of all, I didn’t have the funds and I am really not an academic, I am more a practical hands-on person.  But as internet trends have changed, the way we are able to learn online and gain knowledge over the years has given me the opportunity to fulfil a bucket list dream and learn how to code.
    - question: During the summer of 2016, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: As mentioned above I was always envious of my fellow coding friends and colleagues, it has always been one my bucket list to learn how to code and when I saw the Facebook Ad for the Craft Academy bootcamp for South Africa, I jumped at the opportunity.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: The biggest effect for me is that I just want to learn more, it’s ignited a new passion inside of me and to become even better at my coding. The other important effect is the relationships I gained with my fellow coders they become my best friends and family throughout the bootcamp, I miss our coding sessions a lot.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: I didn’t find the training model challenging. It suited my style of learning. Maybe the time frame to complete tasks was the most challenging, I would have liked to have more completed tasks in my git repository.

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: My name is Gustaf Rudholm. I’m 34 years old and I have worked with e-companies since before the last IT crash. I started my journey with the electronics company NetOnNet in 1999 and I was there for seven years. I gained a great deal of experience there with digital commerce and developed as a businessman.
    - question: In the Fall of 2015, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: I have always been fascinated by how digital products are built with just a bunch of numbers, letters and creativity. Even though I hadn’t written any code before, I had used tons of digital products and services and understood the benefits of learning more about programming.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: That I now code more or less full-time and make things that I only could have dreamed about doing before I participated in the bootcamp. I was very close to deciding not to enroll but now I can barely understand how I could have hesitated. Those twelve weeks have proved to be one of the best investments I have made in myself!
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: Just do it! I have a hard time thinking of better ways to ensure one’s future. Whether you work as a developer or not, you’ll gain a huge benefit from your experiences with Craft Academy. Code is a global language, as important to understand as English. Without that understanding, it will be very difficult to keep up with the future job market.
